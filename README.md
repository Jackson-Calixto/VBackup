# VBackup
Command Line Backup with file versioning

The original version of VBackup can be downloaded from http://www.fileviewer.com/vbackup/

VBackup is a command line program for Windows that is used to make backup copies of directories.

It is similar in functionality to XCOPY and ROBOCOPY, however, VBackup implements file versioning. This means that you can not only restore files from the latest backup, but you can also restore them from any previous backup.

I wrote VBackup for my personal use. It has several limitations, but it does everything that I need. I am releasing it as freeware (free for both private and commercial use) in case others also find it useful.

I have also released the source code on github for anyone interested in doing any further development:
